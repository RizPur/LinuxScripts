# CLI Scripts

This repository contains a collection of personal command-line interface CLI scripts for language note taking using ANKI and productivity tools for interfacing Google Calendar and Google Tasks from cli and a pomo tool.

## Overview

The scripts are organized into two main categories:

- **/lang**: Tools for language learning, specifically for Chinese and French. These scripts are integrated with Anki for spaced repetition.
- **/productivity**: A collection of scripts for managing tasks, time, and daily agendas.

## Getting Started

Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to set up and use the tools within it.

- **[Language Tools](./lang/README.md)**
- **[Productivity Tools](./productivity/README.md)**
