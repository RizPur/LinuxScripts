## Authentication

### First-time Setup

1. **Google APIs**: Run any script for the first time to trigger OAuth flow:
   ```bash
   ./agenda.py list
   # Follow browser prompts to authenticate
   ```

2. **Token Refresh**: If authentication expires, delete the token file:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.venvs/taskscli/token.pickle
   ./tasks.py list  # Re-authenticate
   ```

## Logging

Most scripts log operations to `~/Scripts/logs.log` with timestamps. Check this file for debugging and operation history.

## Dependencies

- **Python packages**: `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-api-python-client`, `python-dotenv`, `tzlocal`
- **System tools**: `pandoc`, `xelatex`, `gcalcli`, `curl`, `jq`, `bc`

## Notes

- All scripts use the local timezone automatically
- Task and event numbers in lists start from 1
- Date offsets: 0=today, 1=tomorrow, etc.
- Time format: 24-hour clock (HH:MM or HH)
- Scripts are designed to work together as a productivity suite
